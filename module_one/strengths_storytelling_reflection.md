# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Look at your initial StrengthsFinder reflection that you completed in week 1 -- how have your perceptions of the top 5 themes changed?
My percetptions haven't changed, however I am able to recgonize where my stegnths are what I need to wrok on. I gained a lot of insight of myself since week 1. I have found that I need to focus more on myself rather then the team. I have found that because of my ability to create a postiive working space, and a team that see's the benefits of having a cohort that is engaged with eachother. Our cohort ROCKS! I have brought a ot to the table and I feel very good about that.

* How are you different today than when you first started at Turing? Where are you stronger now than on day 1?
I was terrifed when I first started Turing. I haven't been terrifed again. I went through a few weeks of feeling like I didn't belong, like I wasn't smart enough. I just needed to realize how I learn, process and retain. Which goes into my other theme, consitiancy. I need to have it.. with everything. 

* Considering how you describe these themes, how do you want others to see you as you continue to progress through Turing?
I really have nejoyed the differences I have met at Turing. I feel like I am liked and respected here. When I told my cohort that I felt like I needed to repeat everyone offered to help me and they have voiced that they want to to stay within their cohort because of my energy. 

* How might these themes play a role in describing your Turing story?
Because I am an includer, I feel that partiucar theme plays a huge part in Turing. I am a team player and excel within a team. I know that moving forward this will be significgant role in my future teams, cohort and career. 

* Even though your Turing story isn't finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How will this story end?

I look forward to not feeling "behind" I feel like mod 2 will be much eaiser for my style of learning. I look forward to everyday at Turing!
